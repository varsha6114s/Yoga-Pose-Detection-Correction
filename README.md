# Yoga Pose Correction - AI Proof of Concept

This project is a solution for the AI Assignment: *Yoga-Themed Proof of Concept*. The focus of this project is **Pose Detection & Correction**, aiming to enhance the yoga experience through AI-powered feedback for pose alignment and accuracy.

---

## Objective

To develop a machine learning-based feature that identifies yoga poses and provides corrective feedback for alignment and accuracy. This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the use of AI in the wellness domain, particularly for yoga practitioners.

## Features

- **Pose Detection**: Detects and classifies various yoga poses from images or videos.
- **Pose Correction**: Provides feedback on alignment and suggestions for improving accuracy.
- **Visualizations**: Highlights key points on the body for better understanding of posture.
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate diverse datasets and user profiles.

---

## Dataset

The project uses publicly available pose estimation datasets or synthetic data generated for yoga postures. Data preprocessing steps include normalization, augmentation, and keypoint extraction.

## Model Architecture

- **Model Type**: [Specify the architecture used, e.g., CNN, RNN, or a pre-trained model like OpenPose or Mediapipe].
- **Key Components**:
  - Feature extraction for body keypoints.
  - Classification of yoga poses.
  - Feedback mechanism for pose alignment.
- **Optimization**: Techniques like learning rate scheduling and dropout were used to enhance performance.
